Fundamentals of testing

## Write down a few test conditions

Look at function `fizzBuzz` inside `random_functions.py`.

Write down five expected input-output scenarios, like this:

* `fizzBuzz(1)` should return `'1'`
* `fizzBuzz(4)` should return `'4'`
* ... and so on

## Finished?

Read over the following articles, if you haven't done so already:
* https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/12/09/improve-your-python-understanding-unit-testing/ is a good post that covers the motivation and basics of unit testing.
* https://powerfulpython.com/blog/automated-tests-types-for-python/ describes the different types of testing. Rather than focusing on the code examples, try to focus on the conceptual differences between the types.
* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5357601/whats-the-difference-between-unit-tests-and-integration-tests is another good explanation between the different types of testing.
